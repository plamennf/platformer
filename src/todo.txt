- Improve menu option colors to stand out more
- Change the backend to SDL3 and GLEW on every system even windows. Remove glex.h and glex.cpp files which handle opengl extension function loading. And remove os_windows.cpp functions.
- Add audio
- Package the assets into the headers which are included when building. Because the assets are a few fonts and 5 textures. This also requires to change the font and shader code to allow reading from memory instead of from a file.
- Save the high scores to a file. Preferably binary so that the players can't change the scores easily.
- Remove shader hotloading in distribution builds.
- Make a build.macos and run.macos file

For update after releasing the game:
- Add more colors to the game(tiles and enemies)
